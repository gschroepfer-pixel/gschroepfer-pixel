        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Guillemette Schroepfer and I am a Biomedical Engineering student double majoring in Religious Studies.
          I am passionate about inclusive design and ethical tech, and I am excited to explore these themes in this course.
          In my free time I enjoy running, spending time outdoors exploring new places, and trying new recipes.

        <h2>What I Care About</h2>
        <p>
          Through my study of relgious studies, I have developed a strong interest in the ethical implications of technology and how 
          it can be designed to be more inclusive and equitable. I am particularly interested in how technology is often developed
          knowing that it will be used by a diverse range of people, but without fully considering the needs and experiences of those users.
          For religious people in particular, additions Electric Medical Records (EMRs) have been implimented to include a patients religious 
          affiliation, but often these lists are not inclusive of all religions and can having their religious needs overlooked.
