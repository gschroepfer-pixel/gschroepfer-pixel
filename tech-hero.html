      <p>
        Arion Long launched Femly after being diagnosed with a tumor linked with chemicals in period products she was using.
        Femly's mission is to increase access to organic period care through smart dispensers that can be placed in schools and corporate restrooms around the country. 
        Arion's work challenges norms in the tech space by addressing a need that is often overlooked and stigmatized: menstrual health. 
        By creating innovative solutions for period care, Arion is advancing equity for people who menstruate, particularly those from marginalized communities who may face barriers to accessing traditional products.
