          <h2>Key definitions</h2>
          <p><strong>Implicit bias</strong> Unconcious favoritism toward or against people of a particular gender, ethnicity, or social group.</p>
          <p>Example: A hiring manager may unconsciously favor candidates with names that sound more "traditional" over those with names that are more "diverse."</p>
          <p><strong>Explicit bias</strong> Conscious prejudice or discrimination against a person or group.</p>
          <p>Example: A hiring manager explicity states that they prefer male canidates for engineering roles.</p>
          <p><strong>Intersectionality</strong> A way of understanding how different aspects of a person's identity (race, gender, class, etc.) can combine to create unique experiences of discrimination or privilege.</p>
          <p>Example: as highlighted in DeGraffenreid v. General Motors (1976). The court initially failed to recognize their case because GM hired Black men (for factory jobs) and white women (for office roles), 
            ignoring that Black women faced unique, combined discrimination based on both race and gender. </p>

          <h2>Implicit Bias Test (IBT/IAT)</h2>
          <p>
            Implicit Bias Test (IBT/IAT) is an online test of quick responses to a series of words and pctures; the test measures response time to the computer
            images as a proxy for implicit bias.

          <h2>Intersectionality </h2>
          <p>
            Intersectionality is a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in the world, n people, and in human experiences. The events
            and conditions of social and politicial life and the self can seldom b understood as shaped by one factor. They are generally shaped
            by many factors in diverse and mutually influencing ways. When it comes to social inequality, people's lives and the organization of 
            power in agiven society are better understood as being shapoed not by a single axis of social division, be it race or gender or class
            but by mnay axes that work togetehr and influence each other. Insersectionalityas as an analytic tool gives pople better access to the 
            complexity of the world and of themselves.
